DONE:
- Implement GBTimers with socketfd on Linux instead of the timerwheel. Done in version 5.4.0.
- testThread2 is failing -> done in ver 5.5.2 (to check on linux)

BUGS


TODO
- GB::Variant::getSize : getDimension might be a better name!!
- Check CONST_CAST ! 
- Changes required include path to '/usr/local/include' instead of  '/usr/local/include/GroundBase'
- Change 'MessageType' to something like 'MessageID' param in UPC Message to point the fact that it's a numeric value.
- Investigate difference between allocated/deallocated bytes in the end (EG. Bytes Allocated 1079 / Freed 1267 ) . No leaks involved.
- GBXMLDocument : check usage of pointers in GBXMLDocumentInitWithBuffer and GBXMLDocumentInitWithFile ( filepath NULL, buffer NULL)
- GBXMLDocument : usage of GBXMLDocumentParseFile vs GBXMLDocumentInitWithFile
- GBXMLDocument : usage of GBXMLDocumentParseBuffer vs GBXMLDocumentInitWithBuffer
- Complete TODO list

Questions:
- Should we allow to retain/release const GBObjects since we have to const-cast pointers? And also is this a good design?
- Should GBRunLoopDispatchAsync/GBRunLoopDispatchAfter be const since they modify the runloop?
