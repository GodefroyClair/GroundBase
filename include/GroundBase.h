/*! \mainpage GroundBase library
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * GroundBase is an implementation library code for FlyKit project.
 * 
 *
 * \section C-API C API guidelines
 *
 * - 'Object oriented' API. GBObject methods all begin with 'GBType'DoSomething (for example GBStringIsEmpty, or GBRunLoopRun) and their first parameter is
 always a 'GBType' instance (for example GBString* myStr = ... ; if( GBStringIsEmpty(myStr)) ... ).
 * - GBObjects are allocated on the head, and you can manage their lifecycle using GBRetain/GBRelease calls. Every created Objects instances using a method with
 'Create' or 'Init' in its name must be released, or memory leaks will occur.
 *
 * Check GBObject File Reference for more informations about GroundBase's runtime system.
 *
 * \section CPP-API C++ API guidelines
 * The GroundBase C++ API is a header only implementation wrapper built around C API. Its main purposes are to provide bridging functions with the STL, and provide (almost)
 automatic GBRetain/GBrelease call cycles.
 * See GroundBase.hpp for more informations.
